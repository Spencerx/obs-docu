 <title>About this Guide</title>
 <info/>
 <para> This guide is part of the &obs; documentation.
  These books are considered to contain only reviewed content, establishing the
  reference documentation of &obsa;.
 </para>
 <para>
  This guide does not focus on a specific &obsa; version.
  It is also not a replacement of the documentation inside of the <link
   xlink:href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Build_Service"
  >&opensuse; Wiki</link>. However, content from the wiki may be included in
  these books in a consolidated form.

  <title>Contributing to the Documentation</title>
  <para>
   The &obsa; documentation is written by the community. And you
   can help too!
  </para>
  <para>
   Especially as an advanced user or an administrator of
   &obsa;, there will be many topics where you can pitch in even if your
   English is not the most polished. Conversely, if you are not very
   experienced with &obsa; but your English is good: We rely on community
   editors to improve the language.
  </para>

  <para>
   It is even possible to host instance-specific content in the official
   Git repository, but it needs to be tagged correctly. For example,
   parts of this documentation are tagged as <tag>&lt;para
   os="opensuse"&gt;</tag>. In this case, the paragraph
   will only become visible when creating the &opensuse; version of a guide.
