  how to set up projects and working with own or foreign sources.

  <para> You can also setup your own project using the sources, spec files and
   patches from another project and develop within this project.</para>

   <para>By default, Open Build Service will strip the maintainer info and now make
   it part of your own project. To clarify, when we speak of a project, it can
   mean just one package or a complete set of packages with their own build
   dependencies. </para>

  <title>Contributing to External Projects Directly</title>
  <para> In case a user does not have commit permissions for a project, they
   can request maintainership permissions for this project. This makes sense if
   the user is already known to the project owners and they trust them as a
   maintainer. There is a way to do this via the request system of OBS, but
   only via osc so far:</para>

  <title>Contributing to Foreign Projects Indirectly</title>
  <para> Users who are new to a given project, either because they are new
   users with Open Build Service or packaging or do not have any deeper
   knowledge about a certain project will not have direct commit permissions.
   However, they can still create a copy of any package source and ask back to
   merge their changes. Open Build Service has support to make this easy.
